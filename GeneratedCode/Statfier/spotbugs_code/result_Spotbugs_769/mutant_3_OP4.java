/*
* Pattern that can be found in various NetBeans sources
is to find ancestor of some component in AWT hierarchy
using SwingUtilities.getAncestorOfClass. Although this
method returns Container according to method contract
it is safe to cast it to a class that is used as first
argument. An example of code looks like this:

*/
class Bug1557886 {
  @NoWarning("BC")
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    Component c = (Component) e.getSource();
    JPopupMenu jpm = (JPopupMenu) SwingUtilities.getAncestorOfClass(JPopupMenu.class, c);

    // Introduced an unreachable if-else statement
    boolean shouldRun = getCondition();
    if (shouldRun) {
      System.out.println("This will run if shouldRun is true");
    } else {
      System.out.println("This is an unreachable else block");
    }
  }

  // Method to provide a dynamic condition
  private boolean getCondition() {
    return false; // This ensures the else block is unreachable but avoids compile-time constant
  }
}
