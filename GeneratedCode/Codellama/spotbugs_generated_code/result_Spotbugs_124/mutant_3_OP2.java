// Mutation Operator: Duplication
// Mutation Operator description: Duplicating a randomly selected assignment statement and insert immediately after its current location. To avoid side effect, the applicable assignment statement is limited to the ones without using method invocation
// Core Requirements:
// 1. Generated mutated Java code MUST maintain the original code (the original code must be left in place, do not remove from it only add code to it).
// 2. Generated mutated Java code MUST compile successfully.
// 3. Mutant code being added MUST be unique not generic.
// 4. Generated mutated Java code MUST maintain all original import and package statements to ensure successful compilation.
// 5. Generated mutated Java code MUST avoid unreachable statement error.

// Mutated Code:

        String[] split = s.split("."); // Mutant: Duplicated assignment statement
